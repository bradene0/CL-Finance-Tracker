# CL-Finance-Tracker ðŸ“Š

A full-featured personal finance tracker web application built with Python and Django. This project is designed to showcase core web development skills, including database modeling, user authentication, session management, and a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) workflow.

## Usage

Visit the homepage to be automatically assigned a temporary guest session. You can immediately begin to add, view, edit, and delete transactions. All data you create is tied to your session and is isolated from other users.

To access the Django admin panel, navigate to `/admin/` and log in with the superuser credentials you created during setup.

## Future Improvements

* Implement data visualization (e.g., charts for spending by category).
* Add transaction filtering by date range and category.
* Develop a full user registration system to allow users to save their data permanently.
